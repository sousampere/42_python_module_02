# Python module 01 : CodeCultivation

A Python project designed for students of School 42.
This module builds on Python fundamentals and previous object-oriented concepts, introducing exception handling and defensive programming through a smart agriculture and garden management simulation, following the official Garden Guardian subject.

This project is an introduction to Python error handling, including try/except blocks, multiple exception types, custom exceptions, raising errors, finally blocks, and building resilient systems that continue running even when failures occur.

Given rules :
- Your code must be written in Python 3.10+
- Your code must respect the flake8 linter standards
- Each exercise must be in its own file
- Use proper naming conventions: classes in PascalCase, functions and variables in
- snake_case
- Include docstrings for functions, classes and methods
- Type hints are encouraged for all functions and methods
- You don’t need to handle input validation unless explicitly mentioned
- Focus on demonstrating error handling concepts clearly
- Your programs must always run without crashing
